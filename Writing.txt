
The game will have three status stats, Morality, Sanity and Health. Morality is determined by choices the player makes, Sanity and Health is lowered by mainly the monsters but also the enviromental hazards.
The player cannot see the exact value, they can only see messages with using the "Gaze in the mirror" prompt, or "Look in the mirror", basically the game will detect if the word "mirror" is said in the sentence and it will show the messages below made out of three parts.
First message will be about your health, second message will be about your morality, third message will be about your sanity. Unless your sanity and morality are average, then only one message will appear for both of your stats. The rest of the messages will be about the rest of your stats like strength, dexterity, etc.

Morality and Sanity

Looking at the mirror:

If Morality and Sanity are both 41-59:

There is nothing out of ordinary about your reflection.

(The message in caps does not appear, it's a hidden stat change.)

Evil morality:

40-31 - Your face seems to have red stains on it, but they disappear as soon as you blink. *LOWERS SANITY BY 10%, INCREASES ATTACK BY 30%*
30-21 - There is no question about it, the red stains on your face are blood, you try to rub your eyes with your hand, but it does not help. *LOWERS SANITY BY 10%, INCREASES DEFENSE BY 30%*
20-11 - Your face is covered in blood, you look down and see your hands are dripping as well, you don't know why, but you just know it's not your blood, as soon as you blink your hands go back to normal. *LOWERS SANITY BY 10%, INCREASES DEXTERITY BY 30%*
11-1 - Your face is dripping with blood, you look down and so are your hands, you can't accept the reality of it, no matter how hard you claw at your own hand the blood does not go away, no matter how hard you rub your eyes it just makes your eyesight more and more red. *LOWERS HEALTH BY 10%, INCREASES ATTACK BY 30%*
 0 - You take a glance at the mirror and quickly look away, but the image is seared into your eyes, it is your tortured soul in hell, you can no longer hold back your true self. *YOUR SANITY IS PERMANENTLY SET AT 0, YOUR ATTACK INCREASES BY 100%*

Good Morality:

60-69 - You take a peak at the mirror and you could've swore you saw a faint halo above your head, for split second, was it a delusion? Regardless, it fuels you with joy. INCREASES SANITY BY 20%.
70-79 - The halo above your head is bright, the glow feels your heart with determination. INCREASES DEFENSE BY 20%.
80-89 - The halo is clearly visible, you can even see a pair of wings behind your back. INCREASES DEXTERITY BY 20%.
90-99 - You can barely see yourself, the holy glow in the mirror is overwhelming you. INCREASES STRENGTH BY 20%.
100 - You take a glance at the mirror and it almost blinds you, but you clearly saw the image of yourself in heaven, you are no longer afraid of death. IF YOUR SANITY IS BELOW 50, IT RESETS TO 50. YOUR SANITY CAN NO LONGER BE LOWERED.
